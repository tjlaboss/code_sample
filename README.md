# Code Sample

Fork of [fftwid](https://github.com/tjlaboss/fftwid), Depletion and burnup simulator for 22.251

## Purpose

 - Write a depletion code
 - Demonstrate temporal convergence and document the final choice of depletion and decay time steps.
 - Produce plots of nuclide inventory and k-infinity vs. burnup
 - Produce tables of nuclide inventories vs. time after burnup
 - Produce a table of PWR Pu/Am/Cm weight percents vs. burnup
 - Using 50 MWd/kg PWR Pu/Am/Cm data, determine what weight percent Pu/Am/Cm needs to be mixed with natural uranium to produce a desired k-infinity.
 - Produce a table of discharge isotopics of fresh fuel, and once-, twice-, and thrice-burnt with MOX.
